                            <br>
                           <p>Though exploration is often associated with places, at its very heart, it’s about the people.

                            <br>
                           <p> In 1951 we opened our doors in New York City, with a clear focus on customer service as we offered the very first complete vacation package. Soon after, we were helping Americans discover the world with international trips. Today, from being a part of one of the world’s largest travel companies, Flight Centre Travel Group to supporting small travel businesses with Independent by Liberty Travel, our commitment to creating connections, providing one-on-one service, and crafting the perfect vacation remains stronger than ever.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Our Mission</h3>

                            <h3>Diversity Vision Statement</h3>
                            <br>
                           <p> Dream Destination Travel Group is committed to improving diversity and inclusion within our workplace as we forge our path forward to create real, lasting change within our company. As a global leader in the travel industry, we also have the opportunity to help bring about change to the sector; we are committed to doing just that.
                            
                            We acknowledge that social injustice exists in the travel industry, and within the communities that our industry impacts. We place equality and equity at the top of our agenda. We will strive to do our part to eradicate the systemic discrimination of marginalized communities within the travel industry.
                            
                            Equal rights are central to the way we operate. We are an anti-racist company and stand with the communities who are discriminated against and facing continuous challenges to amplify their voices. We are committing ourselves to a better positive representation of black, indigenous and people of color and other racialized groups including, but not limited to, members of the LGBTQ2+ community, differently-abled and neurodiverse people. This started with the hiring of our first company Diversity Ambassador and will continue until racism and marginalization is eradicated, and we have achieved representation at all levels.
                            
                            Take a look at the progress and next steps for our company diversity objectives in our report. </p>
